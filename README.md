# CHIP-8-Emulator
A CHIP-8 emulator in C++ to refine my grasp on memory management, registers, opcodes etc.

An extensive readme will be written once the emulator is finished, as of now Roms can be loaded and displayed in text editor, not in SDL yet.
Some Opcodes still need to be revisited.

Feel free to already check out the code!
